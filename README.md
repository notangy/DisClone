# ðŸš¨ THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš¨
I don't mind people looking at or borrowing my work but I give no guarantee that the provided files will work out of the box. This is purely for my own learning until I verify that the training outputs work as intended.

# (Dis)clone yourself!

Wouldn't it be great if you could be online all the time, able to entertain your friends whenever they needed you?
Well, you can't. But you can do the next best thing; introduce a custom Discord bot that's trained on your own message history!

# How does it work?

Make sure you install all the necessary requirements in `requirements.txt` and have python installed on your machine (below version 3.12, pytorch is very picky about the version you have!)


Once that's sorted you'll need .html exports from your most active server channels and private messages (certain tools already exist for these purposes...). Once you have these, run `chatlog_cleaner.py` with your discord username:

e.g. python3 chatlog_cleaner.py --username notangy

This will produce a `training.jsonl` file, which will contain your own messages paired up to prompts from other users in the following format:

{ 
    prompt: other users messages
    response: your own messages
    prompt: other users messages
    response: your own messages....
}

This mimics conversational flow, assuming that each message not from your own username is a prompt.
Due to the way the training data is structured, this works best for data pulled from DMs or small servers.

# Fine-tuning the model

Once you have your .jsonl file, you're ready to train!

Use the `finetune.py` script, which will read your training data and produce a fine-tuned model from gpt-2 
(feel free to replace gpt-2 with any other model that you have access to).

**Note**: Depending on the size of your training data, the fitting process may take a long time with high resource usage. For reference, my data contained over 15000 key/value pairs and took an hour to train with an CUDA enabled RTX 4080. I only recommend using CPU with torch if your data set is very small (<1000)

With your trained model ready, you can test it in the flask app `app.py`. It has a simple text box you can put prompts into to see what your model responds with. 

# Creating the DisClone

The last step will mostly be coming from https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ (assuming your bot code will be written in python).

There's many different use cases for a Discord bot, but for now we'll just have ours respond with generated text whenever someone in a server directly mentions it. 
You'll need to have a bot set up already on the Discord developer portal, and a token for it.
